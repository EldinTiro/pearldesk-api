## Next Up — Recommended Priority Order

1. **Toast notifications** (12.6) — every action currently completes silently; users have no feedback
2. **Confirmation dialogs** (12.7) — staff/appointment deletes fire immediately with no confirmation
3. **Conflict detection on booking** (6.10) — overlapping appointments can be created right now
4. **Manage appointment types admin UI** (6.27) — clinic can't customise types without hitting the DB
5. **Staff detail / profile page** (4.10) — no drilldown from the staff list
6. **Staff availability UI** (4.11) — schedule is stored but not editable in the UI
7. **Provider availability engine** (4.5 / 6.11) — prerequisite for online booking portal
8. **Notifications module** (9.1–9.9) — appointment reminders are a core clinic need
9. **Billing module** (Phase 4) — invoices from completed treatment items, Stripe integration
10. **Production infrastructure** (Phase 5) — Terraform, GitHub Actions CI/CD, security audit

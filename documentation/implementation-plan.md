## Overview

DentFlow is a multi-tenant, cloud-hosted dental practice management application. Each dental clinic is a tenant that gets its own subdomain (e.g. `clinicname.DentFlow.com`). All tenants share a single PostgreSQL database, isolated at the row level via `tenant_id` on every table.

**Core characteristics:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS (row-level isolation, subdomain-based resolution)
- .NET 9 Modular Monolith — Clean Architecture + CQRS
- React 19 + TypeScript frontend
- PostgreSQL 17 database
- Containerised deployment (Docker) to AWS

## Multi-Tenancy

### Strategy: Row-level isolation via Finbuckle.MultiTenant

1. Every database table includes a `tenant_id` column (GUID).
2. `Finbuckle.MultiTenant` resolves the current tenant from the request subdomain.
3. A custom `TenantDbContext` base class registers EF Core Global Query Filters on all tenant-scoped entities, automatically appending `WHERE tenant_id = @current_tenant_id` to every query.
4. **Soft deletes** — All tenant-scoped entities implement a `ISoftDeletable` interface (`IsDeleted`, `DeletedAt`). The Global Query Filter also appends `WHERE is_deleted = false`, ensuring soft-deleted records are invisible to all queries by default. Hard deletes are never performed on clinical or financial data.
5. Tenant creation triggers a Hangfire seeding job (default roles, settings, admin user).

**Subdomain pattern:** `{clinic-slug}.DentFlow.com`

### Soft Delete Interface

```csharp
public interface ISoftDeletable
{
    bool IsDeleted { get; }
    DateTime? DeletedAt { get; }
}
```

All entities that implement `ISoftDeletable` automatically receive both filters in `TenantDbContext.OnModelCreating`:

```csharp
builder.HasQueryFilter(e =>
    EF.Property<Guid>(e, "TenantId") == _currentTenantId &&
    !EF.Property<bool>(e, "IsDeleted"));
```

A `SoftDeleteRepository` base class exposes a `SoftDeleteAsync` method instead of `Remove`, setting `IsDeleted = true` and `DeletedAt = UtcNow`.

---

## Backend Architecture

### Clean Architecture Layers

```
DentFlow.Domain/
│   Entities/            ← Pure domain objects (no EF, no MediatR)
│   ValueObjects/        ← e.g. ToothNumber, Money, PhoneNumber
│   Enums/
│   Errors/              ← Typed error definitions per aggregate
│                          e.g. PatientErrors.NotFound, AppointmentErrors.Conflict

DentFlow.Application/
│   Common/
│     Behaviors/         ← MediatR pipeline: ValidationBehavior, LoggingBehavior, PerformanceBehavior
│     Interfaces/        ← IPatientRepository, IEmailSender, IFileStorage, etc.

│       Commands/        ← CreatePatient, UpdatePatient, DeletePatient, ...
│       Queries/         ← GetPatientById, ListPatients, ...
│     Appointments/
│       Commands/
│       Queries/
│     ... (one folder per feature/module)

DentFlow.Infrastructure/
│   Persistence/
│     DbContext/         ← TenantDbContext (EF Core + Finbuckle integration)
│     Repositories/      ← EF Core implementations of application interfaces
│     Configurations/    ← IEntityTypeConfiguration per entity
│     Migrations/
│   ExternalServices/
│     Email/             ← SES / SendGrid adapter
│     Sms/               ← Twilio adapter
│     Storage/           ← S3 adapter
│   BackgroundJobs/      ← Hangfire job definitions

DentFlow.API/
│   Endpoints/           ← FastEndpoints endpoint classes (one class per operation)
│   Middleware/          ← Tenant resolution, auth, exception fallback
│   Mapping/             ← Request → Command/Query mappers
│   DependencyInjection/ ← Module registration extensions
```

### MediatR Pipeline Behaviors (in order)

1. **`LoggingBehavior`** — logs command/query name, tenant ID, duration
2. **`ValidationBehavior`** — runs FluentValidation; short-circuits with `ErrorOr` validation errors before the handler executes
3. **`PerformanceBehavior`** — logs a warning if a handler exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g. 500ms)

### Error Handling — ErrorOr Result Pattern

Every MediatR handler returns `ErrorOr<T>`. Errors are typed and explicit; no exceptions used for flow control.

```csharp
// Application layer
public async Task<ErrorOr<AppointmentResponse>> Handle(BookAppointmentCommand command, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var patient = await _patients.GetByIdAsync(command.PatientId, ct);
    if (patient is null)
        return Error.NotFound("Patient.NotFound", "Patient does not exist.");

    return new AppointmentResponse(...);
}

// API layer — FastEndpoints maps result to HTTP
public override async Task HandleAsync(BookAppointmentRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
{
    var result = await _sender.Send(req.ToCommand());

    await result.MatchAsync(
        response => SendOkAsync(response, ct),
        errors   => SendErrorsAsync(errors, ct)
    );
}
```

### FastEndpoints Conventions

- One class per operation (e.g. `BookAppointmentEndpoint`, `GetPatientByIdEndpoint`)
- Endpoints grouped by feature using FastEndpoints' built-in `Group`
- API versioning via FastEndpoints versioning (no separate middleware)
- Validation via FluentValidation validators auto-scanned by FastEndpoints
- Authorization via `.Roles(...)` or `.Policies(...)` per endpoint

### Unit Testing

- **Target:** MediatR handlers (Application layer) + Domain objects
- **Tools:** xUnit + NSubstitute + FluentAssertions
- Repositories and external services mocked with NSubstitute
- Both success and error branches of `ErrorOr` results asserted
- One test project per module

## Future Features (Backlog — Lowest Priority)

These features are planned but intentionally deferred until the core product is stable. They should be revisited after Phase 5.

### F1 — Smart Appointment Reminders
Automated SMS reminders sent to patients before appointments.
- Twilio (primary) or MessageBird (fallback/alternative) as SMS provider
- Configurable reminder schedule per tenant (e.g. 24h and 2h before appointment)
- Delivery status tracking and retry logic via Hangfire
- Per-patient opt-out support
- Reminder templates customisable per tenant

### F2 — Interactive Dental Chart
A visual, clickable dental chart for dentists to record per-tooth clinical data.
- Click on any tooth (FDI or Universal numbering) to open a detail panel
- Per-tooth condition tracking: crown, implant, filling, extraction, bridge, root canal, etc.
- Full history of changes per tooth with timestamps
- Visual colour coding by condition type
- Integrates with Treatments module and SOAP clinical notes

### F3 — SOAP Clinical Notes
Structured clinical note-taking linked to appointments and treatment items.
- Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan fields per note
- Notes attached to a specific appointment visit
- View full SOAP history on patient detail page
- Templates per appointment type (e.g. hygiene check vs. crown prep)
- Rich text editor with autosave

### F4 — Online Booking Portal
A public-facing booking page allowing patients to self-schedule appointments.
- Accessible via `{clinic-slug}.DentFlow.com/book` — no login required to browse availability
- Patients select service type, preferred dentist, and available time slot
- Booking confirmation sent via email and SMS
- Configurable booking rules per tenant (lead time, cancellation window, max future bookings)
- Optional patient account creation at time of booking
- Integrates with the provider availability engine in the Appointments module

### F5 — Document Management
Secure per-patient document storage for clinical and administrative files.
- Upload X-rays, OPGs, consent forms, referral letters, and patient photos
- Storage on AWS S3 with time-limited signed download URLs (never expose raw S3 URLs)
- Document categories with custom tags per tenant
- Viewer for common formats: PDF, JPEG, PNG (in-app, no download required)
- Automatic association with a patient and optional appointment/treatment link
- HIPAA-aligned retention policies configurable per tenant

### F6 — Treatment Plan PDF Export & Patient Sign-Off
Allows dentists to export a treatment plan as a branded PDF for the patient to review and sign.
- PDF generated server-side (e.g. QuestPDF or Playwright headless)
- Includes clinic logo, patient details, itemised CDT codes, and estimated cost breakdown
- Digital signature capture (drawn or typed) on patient portal
- Signed copy stored in Documents (F5) with timestamp and IP address
- Plan status advances to `Accepted` automatically on signature

### F7 — Patient Portal
A read-only self-service portal for patients to view their own records.
- Accessible at `{clinic-slug}.DentFlow.com/portal` — separate login with `Patient` role
- View upcoming and past appointments
- Download invoices and receipts
- View and sign treatment plans (integrates with F6)
- Messaging thread with the clinic (not real-time)
- Pre-appointment medical history update form

### F8 — AI Clinical Assistant (DentAI)
An AI-powered chat assistant embedded in the clinician's workflow, with full context of the current patient.
- **Entry point**: a chat panel available on any patient detail page and appointment view
- **Context window**: at query time the assistant receives the patient's full profile — demographics, current treatment plans, SOAP notes, appointment history, allergies, medical alerts, and active billing items — all scoped to the current tenant
- **Example queries a dentist can ask**:
  - *"Summarise this patient's treatment history in one paragraph."*
  - *"Are there any contraindications for prescribing amoxicillin given this patient's allergy list?"*
  - *"Draft a SOAP note for today's crown preparation visit."*
  - *"What CDT codes should I use for a full-mouth debridement?"*
  - *"Suggest a reasonable timeline for this patient's three-item treatment plan."*
- **Architecture**:
  - Backend: `DentFlow.AI` module — new FastEndpoints `POST /ai/chat` endpoint
  - Context builder service collects patient data and formats a system prompt
  - Streams response via Server-Sent Events (SSE) for a real-time typing effect in the UI
  - Provider-agnostic: configurable per tenant — OpenAI GPT-4o (default), Azure OpenAI, or local Ollama
  - **No patient data is sent to third-party providers without explicit tenant opt-in** — compliance gate on the `DentAI` settings page
  - Conversation history stored in Redis (TTL: session only) — never persisted to the database
  - Rate-limited per tenant and per user to control token costs
- **Frontend**: floating chat button on patient detail; expandable side panel with message history, streaming text, and quick-action prompt chips
- **Compliance**: admin can fully disable AI features per tenant; every AI request is logged (prompt hash + response hash) for audit purposes without storing PII in logs

### F9 — Clinic Settings & Customisation
A per-tenant settings area for clinic administrators.
- Working hours per day, holiday/closed dates
- Appointment buffer time defaults
- Notification template editor (email + SMS)
- Branding: clinic name, logo, accent colour (applied to patient portal and PDF exports)
- Billing configuration: default tax rate, invoice footer text, currency
- Subscription plan management and billing history

### F10 — Multi-Location Support
Extends the tenant model to support dental groups with multiple clinic branches.
- Each location is a child record under the tenant
- Staff and providers assigned to one or more locations
- Appointment booking scoped to a specific location
- Per-location working hours and appointment types
- Reporting split by location

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-tenancy strategy | Row-level (Finbuckle) | Cost-effective, simpler ops, strong isolation via EF Global Query Filters |
| Soft deletes | `ISoftDeletable` + Global Query Filter | Clinical/financial data must never be hard-deleted; invisible by default via EF filter |
| Architecture | Modular Monolith | Right-sized for SaaS MVP; modules can be extracted to microservices later |
| API layer | FastEndpoints | Minimal, performant, no reflection-heavy controller conventions |
| CQRS dispatching | MediatR | Industry standard, clean separation of commands and queries |
| Error handling | ErrorOr Result pattern | Explicit, typed errors; no exception-driven flow control |
| Domain events | None (for now) | Keeps complexity low; direct service calls between modules |
| Auth | ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT | No external dependency, full control, multi-tenant friendly |
| Background jobs | Hangfire + PostgreSQL | Reliable retry, no extra infrastructure |
| Deployment | Docker containers on AWS | ECS Fargate + RDS + CloudFront |
| IaC | Terraform | Cloud-portable, battle-tested for AWS |
| Testing | Unit tests (xUnit + NSubstitute) | Handler and domain logic covered; integration tests deferred |
